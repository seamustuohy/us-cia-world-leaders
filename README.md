# CIA World Leaders

The Central Intelligence Agency publishes and updates the online directory of
Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments weekly. The
directory is intended to be used primarily as a reference aid and includes as
many governments of the world as is considered practical, some of them not
officially recognized by the United States. Regimes with which the United
States has no diplomatic exchanges are indicated by the initials NDE.
